## Overview

- This dataset, titled **DoDaG (Data Set on Distance and Giving)**, contains data collected from two experimental paradigms: the **Refugee Paradigm** (field experiment from 2015) and the **Charity Paradigm** (lab experiment from 2017). The data explores the effects of physical distance on charitable giving behavior.

- For a detailed description of the procedures, please read: ** Kühl L., Szech N. (2017): Physical distance and cooperativeness towards strangers, KIT Working Paper 110, November 2017. ISSN: 2190-9806. https://econpapers.wiwi.kit.edu/downloads/KITe_WP_110.pdf **

## Description of the Experiments

### 1. Refugee Paradigm (Field Experiment, 2015)
- **Objective**: To study the effect of physical distance on giving behavior towards strangers (refugees) in a field setting.
- **Sample Size**: 155 participants.
- **Methodology**: In a field setting, participants decide about supporting local refugees at the dispense of money to themselves. The choice is binary: they either keep 15 Euros to themselves or share half of it with refugees at a local refugee camp. We vary physical distance to the refugees while taking the decision.
  
### 2. Charity Paradigm (Lab Experiment, 2017)
- **Objective**: To examine the effect of physical distance on charitable behavior in a controlled lab environment.
- **Sample Size**: 320 participants.
- **Methodology**: In the lab, participants decide about donating money to people in need. We only vary physcial distance to the people in need (in meters or kilomenters as stated in the instructions). No furhter information on the specific location(s) is given.
